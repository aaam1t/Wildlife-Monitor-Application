# Wildlife-Monitor-Application
An interactive prototype of a dangerous wildlife monitoring application built using Figma for the 2022 Engineers Without Borders Challenge.

The proposed application was intended to be used by the residents of the Cairns/Port Douglas region of Northern Queensland to report and monitor for sightings of the dangerous local wildlife.

A full report on the proposed application was created and presented - reach out for more information :)
